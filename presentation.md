# Online Debating

## COVID: The catalyst

When the entire school went into lockdown, one of the ideas that were discussed as part of the contributions of the research team was the introduction of a regular schedule of debates, intended to get us comfortable with the online tools we were using as well as to encourage students to speak their minds.

## Thoughts about online debates

Our plan, and what we thought of

- The importance of a moderator (Thank you Frankie Inguanez)
- Keeping the debate on target
- Ensuring a balanced set of contributions
- Encouraging people to say what they feel
- Technological issues?

What other issues could there be?

## Summary of writeups

We held two debates, one regarding the changes brought about by the shift to online learning, and another (similar) debate related to the design of a virtual campus.

The following slides will present a summary of what came out of the debates, and some ideas for building a debate friendly culture within MCAST to encourage researchers to discuss their findings and debate them civilly and productively.  

We strongly believe that this is necessary and needs to be encouraged and built in to the culture of any educational institution.  

## Debate 1

Students brought up several points related to the following elements:

- **Time management** - Less wasted time getting to school.  
  
- **Blended learning** - Being at home has disadvantages due to noises and disturbances at home.  
  
- **The level** - The teacher as a 'guide' to research.

- **Resources** - More resources for online learning.  

## Debate 1 (contd)

- **Class layout** - Learning at home is comfortable, but some points were raised about the current class layout at IICT, and the fact that students need to lean backwards to see the lecturer during lessons.  
- **Online content creation** - Lecturers should have all the resources necessary to do online content creation if schools have to be done online.

Needless to say, looking back at these points, we have certainly learned a lot last year!  

## Debate 2 - 1

The second debate was also COVID related.  We were in the middle of the COVID crisis and coming back to school the following year was not looking likely.  I was personally involved in setting up a good setup for the dissertation vivas to take place and the practice I had in setting the first debate up was quite useful.  

## Debate 2 - 2

The points brought up in the second debate were as follows:  

- **Size of online classrooms** - Even though the size limitation seems to be less important in online classes, larger classes were still felt to be detrimental to the learning process.  
- **Electronic library resources** - Importance was given to electronic access to library resources.  Quite a lot of interest was taken into this as the students were quite busy with their dissertations at the time, and found the resources at the library to be useful, but less accessible at the time.  

## Debate 2 - 3

- **Social Interaction & Mental Health** - The point was made that education is a social event and the social relationship between the educator and the student is not simply a process of transferring content from one person to the other.  Online schooling was diminishing this relationship.  Ancillary to this was the fact that students who were perhaps feeling shy could fade into the background and not attract attention simply because they would not ask questions in the online sessions.  It is harder for the lecturer to gain visibility on the people who participate less online.  

## Debate 2 - 4

- **The hybrid classroom** - Most students overwhelming were in favour of at least some physical presence, in spite of the risks.  
- **The curriculum** - An official definition of what constitutes online learning and the level required by curriculum would help reduce the uncertainty surrounding the way online learning is being done (this has since been discussed even at higher levels at MCAST).  
- **Climate change** - Is the covid crisis a product of mankind's lack of respect for the environment?  Could a shift to online campuses and online interactions and the corresponding drop in pollution be the way to reverse the dramatic effects of climate change?  

## Our thoughts

I would personally like to thank Mr. Frankie Inguanez for his invaluable help in organizing the ICTAR debates, as I believe that they would not have taken place without his excellent moderation efforts.  We are looking forward to having new debates tackling various different topics in a reasoned way.  

The plan for future debates is based on the selection of topics from a selection of the most common aspects of dissertation SOIs now that we have a clearer idea of what schooling is like in these days.  

## Thoughts - continued

The long term effects of such a dramatic shift in schooling have yet to manifest themselves.  A lot of us here have learned a lot about online teaching in a very short period of time.  MCAST has been through a wrenching change, which has good and bad points.  An important part of processing this change and understanding what was done is debating the initiatives carried out.  

- We need to build a culture of debate and questioning each other in a civil and respectful way to become better.  
- The shift to online is an opportunity to do this, and rekindle our desire to debate.

## Conclusion

As researchers we need to be ready to debate and defend our conclusions based on the science we do.  I feel the best way to set up critical thought in our students is to encourage debate.
